# vSQLize
SQL Visualizer in Browser

vSQLize is an in-browser SQL DBMS with a React GUI.
It leverages the speed of React and React Table to dynamically save and re-render SQL data as you move across cells. It displays auto-generated queries and allows you to manually enter your own raw SQL queries, so you can manipulate data as though working in a spreadsheet environment.
